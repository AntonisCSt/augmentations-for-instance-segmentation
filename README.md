# Augmentations for instance segmentation
### Tutorial inspired and almost copied entirly (:P) from https://www.kaggle.com/blondinka/how-to-do-augmentations-for-instance-segmentation/notebook


In this notebook we are using the Albumentations library. 


Albumentations (https://github.com/albu/albumentations) to perform augmentations of images together with multiple annotations (in an instance segmentation problem), similar to those in the coco dataset. 

Instance segmentation has a higher complexity for Augmentation because of the different classes image segments. We are using albumenation in this kaggle tutorial to lift this compelxity burden.

Happy learning
